# Technical documentation

## Overview

BCODMONT is an OBO style application ontology created using the [Ontology Development Kit \(ODK\)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit). As such it makes use of a variety of features generated by ODK such as ontology imports a standardized makefile and githhub release-generation. 

The **B**CODMO **S**emantic **M**odel \(**BSM**\) is created within BCODMONT and acts as a controlled vocabulary for the BCODMO data managers to annotate data with. 



## Imports

In order to re-use ontology terms form existing OBO ontologies such as ENVO, UBERON or CHEBI, we need to import them into our repository. 

### Add new terms to import

In order to import new terms from ontologies we are already importing from we need to do the following:

#### Running all imports

We can run all existing imports from `bcodmont/src/ontology` with the following command: 

```text
./run.sh make all_imports
```

Note when running on linux systems depending on permissions one may need to add `sudo` in front of the above command. 

#### Running individual imports

To re-run an individual ontology \(instead of all imported ontologies\) one can run a command such as the following, where for example the Gene Ontology `go` is the ontology of interest. One would run the following from `bcodmont/src/ontology`: \(note `sudo` maybe required\)

```text
./run.sh make imports/go_import.owl
```



## Import new ontologies

In order to import a new OBO ontology we need to do the following:
