# Technical documentation

## \# Overview

BCODMONT is an OBO style application ontology created using the \[Ontology Development Kit \(ODK\)\]\([https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit)\). As such it makes use of a variety of features generated by ODK such as ontology imports a standardized makefile and githhub release-generation. 

The Bcodmo Semantic Model \(BSM\) is created within BCODMONT and acts as a controlled vocabulary for the BCODMO data managers to anotate data with. 



## \# Imports

In order to re-use ontology terms form existing OBO ontologies such as ENVO, UBERON or CHEBI, we need to import them into our repository.
