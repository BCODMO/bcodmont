colony				BSM:0030001	colony				NCIT:C61515	"Two or more conspecific individuals living in close association with, or connected to, one another."		To add to ENVO perhaps as SC to animal habitation. Or perhaps PCO?					http://bcodmo/sm#biology	http://bcodmo/sm#ecology

population	coverage			BSM:0030003	coverage	population				"How much surface of a plot/surface/location that an organism (or group of organsims) covers; cover is a method of determining relative abundance of a plant or sessile animal based on the amount of space they occupy within a plot of substrate. In this method, rather than counting the number of individuals, each species is assigned a percent cover based on a visual estimate of how much of the sample plot they occupy"							http://bcodmo/sm#biology	http://bcodmo/sm#ecology

population	capture	catch per unit effort		BSM:0030004	catch per unit effort	capture				Catch per unit effort (fisheries term). Indirect measure of abundance for a target species.		This could be furthur broken down and clarified. Perhaps a more specific term for collection of fish. TBD in OBO.					http://bcodmo/sm#biology	http://bcodmo/sm#ecology
