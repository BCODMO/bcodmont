# Export formats

Using [Robot Convert see docs here](https://robot.obolibrary.org/convert) we can generate the following formats:

```
json -> OBO Graphs JSON, protege exports JSON-lD which is very different the the robot version.
obo -> OBO Format, can't get this to export correctly from protege.
ofn -> OWL Functional, identical to the owl Functional export from protege.
omn -> Manchester, ROBOT export is almost exactly the same as what protege does minus prefixes.
owl -> RDF/XML, ROBOT exports exactly the same as what protege does.
owx -> OWL/XML, ROBOT export is almost exactly the same as what protege does minus prefixes.
ttl -> Turtle, ROBOT export is almost exactly the same as what protege does minus prefixes.
```

Giving us the following files: with their (somewhat) equivalent protege exports:
```
ROBOT                   Protege
qualifiers_robot.json   qualifiers_protege_json_ld.owl
qualifiers_robot.obo    //can't get it export
qualifiers_robot.ofn    qualifiers_protege_owl_functional.owl
qualifiers_robot.omn    qualifiers_protege_manchester.owl
qualifiers_robot.owl    qualifiers_protege_rdf_xml.owl
qualifiers_robot.owx    qualifiers_protege_owl_xml.owl
qualifiers_robot.ttl    qualifiers_protege_ttl.owl
```
Finally I also added `qualifiers_owl2vowl.json`, generated by OWL2VOWL http://vowl.visualdataweb.org

@Jaci I suggest starting with `qualifiers_robot.json` as it's the most straightforward to create json format.
